## Welcome To Robust Reindeer! ##

This submission to the 8th Code-Jam of the Python-Discord channel is a
Rubik's cube, rendered in a text user interface (that was a
constraint) using the asciimatics package, and addressing the theme
"thinking inside the box".

Just like a real world Rubik's cube, you can move this cube around to
look at it from all sides. And, of course, you can rotate the
individual discs it is made up of to first scramble up the order and
then to try and solve it into perfect ordering again.

For more info, please select either "Mouse Movements" or "Keyboard
Commands" buttons from above, and they will help you to see how to use
our Rubik's Cube!
