This project has been designed and coded in about a week by the
following Python-Discord members:

Bj√∂rn (team-lead)
aaronshenhao
mathsman
Dude Saber
HellRevenger
Keppo

Contributions included conception, the mathematics required for the
geometry and 3D rendering, exploration of TUI frameworks, various
proof-of-concept prototypes, the final coding, and of course this
documentation.

## Outlook ##

While the project is presentable, some additional improvements could
be made. Since this project is licensed under the MIT licence, you are
more than welcome to add to it. The following would be nice to have:

- Improvements to the frame rate in high-resolution terminals, perhaps
  by not clearing the entire terminal in each frame.
- Animation of the disc rotations.
- A scrambling option.
- A "show me the solution from here" option.
