USER LEVEL
-desktop/info change numbers to letters (1-a,26-z ect) hint in hint.txt to get password atomic
-decrypt hosting/hostdoc with atomic, scan the ip then translate the morse code for network user password, NeutronAtomNet
-decrypt original_key with atomic. compare both keys for later to translate stuff.

NETWORK LEVEL
-login to network using NeutronAtomNet password
-in netstats, find hidden words in netdata.txt = onesixfour,
-scan port 164 to get net_config password: app12ut
-open netconfig and decrypt content with app12ut
-in data.txt find port 988, translate the morse code for password ATOMPASSWORDTEMP
-use pwscan to find 5th password (54354fd32) and then add ATOMPASSWORD TEMP after it to get port decryption password
-decrypt ports files with 54354fd32ATOMPASSWORDTEMP,
-scan all three ports in each file (ports 7, 74, 522)
-add them together in order to make ip, 444.5123.4123 then ipscan this ip to get password TUJ
-decrpyt external_connections with TUJ,
-in connections.txt find port 529 which hints to third ip
-run ipsearch, third one when scanned returns AtomToortpf
-decrypt rootpassword with password ^ AtomToortpf
-get root password from file = CobaltAtomRoot

ROOT LEVEL
-login to root using password CobaltAtomRoot,
-in desktop/meeting_transcript find port 62, scan this for zwqrt23p
-decrypt meetingdata with this password (zwqrt23p), use the original key from user directory to translate content of meetingdata
-translates to port 91 and port 80, scan both ports,
-port 80 shows ttgrsfll which translates command.txt which shows the shutdown command.
-port 91 explains that you need to add word 6+7+10+11 from meeting_transcript
-add these words together to form AtomicProgramIranShutdown,
-this password decrypts password.txt which is morse code,
-translate that morse code to get CODEREDATOMNANO
-use this password (CODEREDATOMNANO) to shutdown the operating system with: (must also be logged into root)
-shutdown (password)
