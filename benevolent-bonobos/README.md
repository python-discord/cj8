# Getting Inside The Box

This game was developed by the team [**Benevolent Bonobos**](#About-Us), during the [Summer Code Jam 2021](https://pythondiscord.com/events/code-jams/8/) held by [Python Discord](https://discord.com/invite/python).

Teams that participated in the code jam had to create a TUI based on the theme _Think Inside the Box_.

## How To Play
<!-- Insert the tutorial we made in the game here?-->
<!-- The video goes here? -->
1. There are 6 options in start menu:
    - Start: Play the normal levels.
    - Infinite: Never ending gameplay.
    - Tutorial: How to play.
    - Credits
    - Leaderboard
    - Quit
2. Use **arrow keys** to move.
3. On starting, a glimpse of the whole maze will be shown. After it disappears, the game will start.
4. Player has to reach `&` with minimum collisions with the walls and in minimum time.
5. Boxes:
    - The place to stop and think.
    - Will show the part of the maze associated with the box.
    - Time slows down here.
6. Echolocation:
    - Press `e` to make a noise.
    - An echo will come from the direction in which player last moved.
    - The echo will get stronger the nearer the player is to the wall.
7. Persistence:
    - It acts as a score for a player.
    - Higher is better.
    - It will decrease with time.
    - It will decrease more and more with each collision.
    - Since time slows down in a box, persistence will decrease slower inside the box.
    - It is visible in the top right corner.
8. In the top left corner, the number of collisions made in the current level is visible.
9. On pressing `q`, the game will be paused. There will be an option to _play again_ or _quit_.
10. In normal mode, a player can play 9 levels.
11. In infinite mode, a player will have to press `q` for quitting.
12. After completing all normal levels, a player, if they want, can put their name in the _leaderboard_ which stores their score.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8.6 or greater

## Future Improvements


- Reveal the map with animation at the start of the level.
- Allow player to move during echo.
- Fix bug: Hitting leaderboard in the main menu exits game. (This can be fixed with [this change](https://github.com/pritam-dey3/summer-code-jam-2021/commit/64eb2852514e91749fe706433363a8941d290d6c), we shall update the repo once the code jam finishes.)
- Fix bug: Game background music does not start on tutorial. (This can also be fixed by [this commit.](https://github.com/pritam-dey3/summer-code-jam-2021/commit/a010bab5a2360cf26d99b25f5f185ef5a578b67d))
- Add _Main menu_ option in pause menu. ([This](https://github.com/pritam-dey3/summer-code-jam-2021/commit/3368968c668307b36278629b75b02433fca18592) will do it)
