  prologue: |
    The urge to open the box overcame her. Horrible things flew out of the box including greed, envy, hatred,
    pain, disease, hunger, poverty, war, and death. All of lifeâ€™s miseries had been let out into the world.
    She slammed the lid of the box back down. The last thing remaining inside of the box was hope.
    Ever since, humans have been able to hold onto this hope in order to survive the wickedness that she had let out.
  failed: |
    The box has consumed all hope.

    Nothing besides wickedness remains.
  Greed: >
    Greed is not a defect in the gold that is desired but in the man who loves it
    - [/]St. Augustine
  Envy: >
    It is in the character of very few men to honour without envy a friend who has prospered
    - [/]Aeschylus
  Hatred: >
    Hatred does not cease by hatred, but only by love; this is the eternal rule
    - [/]Buddha
  Pain: >
    Pain is temporary. It may last a minute, or an hour, or a day, or a year, but eventually it will subside and
    something else will take its place. If I quit, however, it lasts forever
    - [/]Lance Armstrong
  Disease: >
    I think the biggest disease the world suffers from in this day and age is the disease of people feeling unloved. I
    know that I can give love for a minute, for half an hour, for a day, for a month, but I can give. I am very happy to
    do that; I want to do that
    - [/]Princess Diana
  Poverty: >
    The world is a dangerous place, not because of those who do evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing
    - [/]Albert Einstein
  Malevolence: >
    The evil that is in the world always comes of ignorance, and good intentions may do as much harm as malevolence, if
    they lack understanding
    - [/]Albert Camus
  Wickedness: >
    The belief in a supernatural source of evil is not necessary; men alone are quite capable of every wickedness
    - [/]Joseph Conrad
