The game would work like this: the player `@` is trapped in a box, to escape he has to realize that he/she is
inside the box and, for that, he has to find and tag the 4 walls that trap him/her.

Additionaly, the player can only see a certain distance (in the examples below I will draw the entire map and a <span style="color:blue">&#x1F535; circle </span> to represent his vision, but in the actual game everything beyong the &#x1F535; circle would be black).

On the picture above, the player would have to tag the &#128997;red walls &#128997; 1,2,3 and 4. To be able to escape.

Ok, seems pretty easy on a simple level, things can get bigger:

Now here, if the player targets wall &#128997; 5 he/she would have to try again.

As the game progresses the maps would become bigger and we could add more stuff.

Some stuff that could be added:

1. Bread crumbs to leave a mark on the floor so the player would know he/she has been there before
2. A lamp the player could leave somewhere and help light part of the map.
3. We could add enemies too, or dangerous places.

Let me know what you think on discord :D
